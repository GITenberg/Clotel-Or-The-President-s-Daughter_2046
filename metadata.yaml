description: "Clotel; or, The President's Daughter is an 1853 novel by United States\
  \ author and playwright William Wells Brown about Clotel and her sister, fictional\
  \ slave daughters of Thomas Jefferson. Brown, who escaped from slavery in 1834 at\
  \ the age of 20, published the book in London. He was staying after a lecture tour\
  \ to evade possible recapture due to the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act. Set in the early\
  \ nineteenth century, it is considered the first novel published by an African American\
  \ and is set in the United States. Three additional versions were published through\
  \ 1867.\nThe novel explores slavery's destructive effects on African-American families,\
  \ the difficult lives of American mulattoes or mixed-race people, and the \"degraded\
  \ and immoral condition of the relation of master and slave in the United States\
  \ of America.\" Featuring an enslaved mixed-race woman named Currer and her daughters\
  \ Althesa and Clotel, fathered by Thomas Jefferson, it is considered a tragic mulatto\
  \ story. The women's relatively comfortable lives end after Jefferson's death. They\
  \ confront many hardships, with the women taking heroic action to preserve their\
  \ families.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
